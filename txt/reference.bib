  abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a DNN, called BirdNET, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four eBird hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short FFT window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, BirdNET achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, BirdNET and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.},

PWD is a serious threat to forests, and the damage caused by this disease results in significant economic loss.

  abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is a non-invasive tool for automated wildlife monitoring. This technique has several advantages and addresses many of the biases related to traditional field surveys. However, locating animal sounds using autonomous recording units (ARUs) can be technically challenging and therefore ARUs have traditionally been little employed to estimate animal density. Nonetheless, several approaches have been proposed in recent years to carry out acoustic-based bird density estimations. We conducted a literature review of studies that used ARUs for estimating bird densities or bird abundances in order to describe the applications and improve future monitoring programmes. We detected a growing interest in the use of ARUs for estimating bird density in the last 6 years (2014–19), with a total of 31 articles assessing the topic. The most common approach was to estimate the relationship between the number of vocalizations per recording time with bird density or bird abundance estimated in the field (61\%). In 26 studies (79\%), bird estimates obtained by human surveyors agreed with those obtained using ARUs. Some approaches have proven able to reduce biases in acoustic surveys, such as considering imperfect detection (spatially explicit capture–recapture, using microphone arrays), applying paired acoustic sampling to control for different sampling radius between humans and ARUs, or including relative sound level measurements that allow researchers to estimate bird distance to recorder. However, several studies did not include any covariates to reduce existing biases and some did not estimate the sampling radius of the recorder, which may hamper future comparisons between human and ARU surveys. Future studies should include a measurement of the sampling radius of the recorder employed to be able to obtain density estimations using ARUs. Finally, we provide some guidelines to improve the applicability of ARUs to infer bird population estimates in future studies.},

  abstract = {Robust automatic detection of moving objects in a marine context is a multi-faceted problem due to the complexity of the observed scene. The dynamic nature of the sea caused by waves, boat wakes, and weather conditions poses huge challenges for the development of a stable background model. Moreover, camera motion, reflections, lightning and illumination changes may contribute to false detections. Dynamic background subtraction (DBGS) is widely considered as a solution to tackle this issue in the scope of vessel detection for maritime traffic analysis. In this paper, the DBGS techniques suggested for ships are investigated and optimized for the monitoring and tracking of birds in marine video content. In addition to background subtraction, foreground candidates are filtered by a classifier based on their feature descriptors in order to remove non-bird objects. Different types of classifiers have been evaluated and results on a ground truth labeled dataset of challenging video fragments show similar levels of precision and recall of about 95\% for the best performing classifier. The remaining foreground items are counted and birds are tracked along the video sequence using spatio-temporal motion prediction. This allows marine scientists to study the presence and behavior of birds.},
